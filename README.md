# Pokemon Wyrmwood (pokewyrmwood)
A beginner's attempt at a narrative rom hack based on [PokeCrystal][pokecrystal] . It's very much a novice endeavour, so I apologise if this repo is a mess.

# Story
A comet is headed for the planet. Its impact will cause the end of our world as we know it, from the initial brutal collision to the vicious earthquakes and tidal waves that will follow. Despite the best efforts of scientists and champions alike, it's estimated we have mere weeks - if not days - to live, and so chaos is taking hold as people begin to live like they won't see tomorrow.

You are a trainer in the Nomaia region, ground zero for the comet's impact, beginning your journey a little late. Try to make the most of it.

# Features
- A mixed dex with pokemon from across the world, from Kanto to Paldea, and a few Nomaian native mon to catch!
- Fairy type
- Physical-Special split
